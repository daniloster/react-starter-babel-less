# React Starter Kit + Gulp + Babel + Less
> Very simple React Starter Kit with ES6 (Babel), gulp and less.

Documentation
------------
This starter kit comes only with preconfigured gulpfile, which compiles ES6 code to ES5 via Babel, LESS to CSS. It is not very suitable for complex apps since it does not include any router or any meaningful data manipulation architecture like Flux (I highly recommend it).

How to build
------------
> $ gulp

How to run
----------
> $ gulp watch

How to update
-------------
> $ npm install
